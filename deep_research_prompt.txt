# Deep Research Prompt: IMAP CampaignWizard Architecture & Campaign Strategy

## Context & Project Overview
You are acting as the Lead Architect and Strategist for the "IMAP CampaignWizard".
**Current Stack (Non-negotiable):**
- **Backend:** Python 3.12, Litestar, Msgspec, ArangoDB (Graph DB).
- **Frontend:** Svelte 5 (Runes), TailwindCSS.
- **AI Integration:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash via `google-genai` SDK.

**Goal:**
We are building a "CampaignWizard" to automate Google Ads Search Campaign creation.
The workflow is:
1.  **Deep Research (YOU):** Analyzes landing pages/company docs and outputs a **Standardized Research Report** defining the best campaign strategy (AdGroups, Keywords, Assets).
2.  **Internal LLM (Gemini 3 Flash):** Reads YOUR report and populates the "New Campaign" UI in the CampaignWizard.
3.  **User (Human):** Reviews the pre-filled campaign, interacts with the UI (select/regenerate), and pushes to Google Ads.

## Your Task
You must produce two distinct deliverables in your output:
1.  **Standardized Research Report Structure**: Define the exact structure of the report you would generate for a specific client.
2.  **Implementation Guide**: Provide a technical guide on how to build the "CampaignWizard" to consume this report.

## Part 1: The Standardized Research Report (Template Definition)
Define a markdown-based report structure that is optimized for machine reading (by Gemini 3 Flash). It must cover a **Complete Search Campaign**.
Sections must include:
-   **Campaign Settings:** Name, Budget, Bidding Strategy, Networks (Search Only), Locations, Languages.
-   **AdGroup Structure:** Logic for segmentation (e.g., "HR Managers" vs "CEOs").
-   **For Each AdGroup:**
    -   **Keywords:** List of keywords with Match Types (Broad, Phrase, Exact).
    -   **RSA Assets:**
        -   **Headlines (15x):** Mix of keywords, benefits, trust, call-to-action.
        -   **Descriptions (4x):** Detailed value propositions.
    -   **Target Audience:** Brief persona description.

*Instruction for YOU (The Researcher):* When you execute the actual research later, you will fill this template. For now, define the *Schema/Template* of this report.

## Part 2: Implementation Guide (CampaignWizard Architecture)
Based on the report structure above, plan the implementation of the "CampaignWizard" module.

### A. Frontend UI (Svelte 5)
-   **Layout**:
    -   **Header**: Breadcrumbs "Hub > New Campaign".
    -   **Sidebar (Left, 1/6 width)**: Vertical navigation (General, AdGroup A, AdGroup B...).
    -   **Main Content (Right)**: Scrollable sections corresponding to the sidebar.
-   **"Three-Color Logic" (Review System)**:
    -   **Assets (Headlines/Descriptions)**: Displayed as tiles/chips.
    -   **Interaction**:
        -   **Click 1 (Green)**: Approved/Keep.
        -   **Click 2 (Red)**: Rejected/Regenerate.
        -   **Default (White)**: Neutral/Pending.
    -   **Regenerate Button**: Sends ONLY the "Red" items back to the Internal LLM to generate replacements based on the "Green" context.
-   **State Management**: How to handle the campaign data object using Svelte Runes (`$state`).

### B. Backend Architecture (Litestar + ArangoDB)
-   **Data Models (Msgspec)**: Define the `CampaignStructure`, `AdGroup`, `Keyword`, and `Asset` structs needed to parse the Research Report.
-   **API Endpoints**:
    -   `/generate/from-report`: Accepts the Report Text -> Returns structured Campaign Object.
    -   `/generate/refine`: Accepts current state + "Red" items -> Returns new suggestions.
-   **Google Ads Mapping**: Briefly confirm how these fields map to the Google Ads API resource structure (e.g., `Campaign`, `AdGroupCriterion`, `AdGroupAd`).

## Instructions for the Deep Research Agent
"Please execute a Deep Research to define the optimal Campaign Strategy and the technical Implementation Plan for the IMAP CampaignWizard.
1.  **Analyze** the provided documents (Landing Page, Company Info - *to be uploaded by user*) to understand the product.
2.  **Structure** a 'Strategic Campaign Report' containing specific AdGroups, Keywords, and RSA Assets (Headlines/Descriptions) tailored to the product.
3.  **Technical Plan**: Specify the Svelte components and Litestar endpoints required to ingest this report and build the UI described above.
4.  **Output Format**: Markdown."
